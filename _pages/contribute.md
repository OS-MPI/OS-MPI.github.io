# To submit your project to OS-MPI:
There are a few different approaches to submitting your work. In any case [see the submission document](https://github.com/OS-MPI/OS-MPI.github.io/blob/master/OS-MPI_Project%20Submission.docx) which summarizes the information necessary to populate a project page on this site. After you send us the necessary information you can do on of the following:
1. Request write access from [the contact us page](/contact/) and upload your repository directly
2. Send us the files that you would like to submit to OS-MPI with any supporting information and we can upload it (details below).
3. If you already have a hosted open-source project that you would like referenced here, send us the link, description, and images so we can include your projects on the site with external links.

### For option 1:
#### Adding files to OS-MPI
* Reach out to get write access for the GitHub organization
* Click "New" on [the main page](https://github.com/OS-MPI), then title your repository and give it a brief description
* Upload the files you would like to include
#### Adding project to the page
* In the "OS-MPI.github.io" repository go to [the projects folder](https://github.com/OS-MPI/OS-MPI.github.io/tree/master/_projects) and copy the template.md file [here](https://github.com/OS-MPI/OS-MPI.github.io/blob/master/_projects/template.md). 
* Re-save it with a new name and fill in the information where appropriate. Make sure it is in the same directory as the template.
* It might take 20 minutes to sync to the site. 
* If you have trouble reach out. The syntax is not error-tolerant.


### For option 2:
#### Adding files to OS-MPI
* If the files aren't prohibitively large, email us a .zip (or .tar.gz) with the files you would like to submit.
* If they are too large, is probably best to reach out and discuss with us what the easiest approach is. 

#### Adding your project to the page
* If you send us the image in the document linked above we can do it. 

### Option 3:

* Email us with the [the submission document](https://github.com/OS-MPI/OS-MPI.github.io/blob/master/OS-MPI_Project%20Submission.docx) filled out.
