# Project Home
Welcome to "The Open-Source MPI (OS-MPI)" project administered by the Magnetic Resonance Physics and Instrumentation Groupâ€™s Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) team. Within this website are descriptions of many of the MPI systems developed by either us or other contributing groups. The motivation for building an open-source platform is that we believe the most efficient way for the modality to develop is by freely sharing information and lowering the threshold for new investigators to enter the field by sharing imager designs. We have benefited from the support of other groups and hope this will aide other new (or established) labs. In the spirit of the project we encourage groups to [reach out to the primary authors](/contact) of this site with contributions, critiques, and any questions.
