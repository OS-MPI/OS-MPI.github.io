This is the "MPS" device developed by the MIT/MGH group which is intended to be a cheap and accesible platform for characterizing SPIONs. It was designed to be both easily assembled and implemented, additionally the system was designed to be affordable. The cost is anywhere from $500 if you have a DAQ board (such as NIDAQ USB 6211) already, but can far exceed that if dedicated DAQs/precision amplifiers are purchased.

Within this project is also code (MATLAB) to analyze raw data for magnetometry/spectroscopy/relaxometry.
