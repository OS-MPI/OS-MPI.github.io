This is the "MPS" device developed by the MIT/MGH group which is intended to be a cheap and accesible platform for characterizing SPIONs. The device is well-suited for groups looking to develop nanoparticles as well as those who are interested in understanding SPION properties for imaging or application studies. The cost is anywhere from $500 (if you have a DAQ board such as NI-USB-6211 or NI-USB-6363 already) to $3500 if you need to purchase DAQs and amplifiers. 

Within this project is also code (MATLAB) to analyze raw data for magnetometry/spectroscopy/relaxometry.
