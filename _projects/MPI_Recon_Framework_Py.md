The MPIRF is developed by Python 3.8. It could integrate different MPI reconstruction algorithm and 2-D MPI scan simulation. The current version provides two main function files: MPIRFmain.py and MPIRFUImain.py.

**Key Specifications**: Python toolkit, reconstruction, scan simulation, software framework.
