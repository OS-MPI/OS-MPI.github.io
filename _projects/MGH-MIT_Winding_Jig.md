# Description
This is the device designed by the MGH/MIT group to assist in the manufacture of electromagnets. While it was designed to wind large magnets (6mm square wire around a ~1m long "racetrack"), the system is designed such that it is easy to adapt to other shapes and sized. A wire straightener and means for motor-assisted winding are included in the design.
