This project is a field-free line (FFL)-based magnetic particle imaging system developed by the MIT/MGH Magnetic Resonance Physics and Instrumentation Group. It is designed with with the goal of having high sensitivity for functional neuroimaging studies of rats, and would be equally well-suited for other applications that require high sensitivity such as cell-tracking experiments. In the current configuration, the imager can produce images with roughly 2mm resolution (with VivoTrax) and has a temporal resolution of approximately 3 seconds.
